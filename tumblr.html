            <h3> Threats </h3>


            <h4>Human error and not paying attention
            </h4>

           <p>This could include simply posting an accidental post or unknowingly clicking a phishing link. Tumblr also contains adult content or as known on tumblr ‘nsfw’ content which an user can accidently access if clicked on a wrong tag. This also includes not paying attention to your Tumblr. Leaving your profile not monitored could lead to infecting with a virus which then could be spread to your friends list.
           </p>

            <h4> Phishing scams
            </h4>

            <p>A study about the current state of phishing, explains that phishing is a kind of “social engineering attack” which consists of using deceiving emails to hoax victims into sharing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details and other personal information.  Those emails are often try to imitate an email from trusted companies to again the trust of the users that are being targeted. The main concept of this attack that instead of targeting the system, it’s the users using these systems are the targets.  As seen in the Anti-Phishing Working Group, 2017 report the number of users targeted are very high with number as high as 51, 265 in March of 2017 for number of unique phishing websites detected.
            </p>

            <p>An example of this occurred in 2012. Hackers created a special spam post that was displayed on users’ dashboards. While this scam was not malicious, it did cause inconvenience to the users of Tumblr.
            </p>

            <h4>Pop-ups</h4>

            <p>Pop-up adverts are common on those kind of websites as this is how they make their money. However, those can be annoying and unfortunately on occasion dangerous. </p>

            <p>They can lead user to unwanted websites such as adults’ sites or simply ones that are not secure. </p>

            <p>Especially bad pop-ups are used to sell anti-viruses programs which are infect malware. Those pop-ups pretend to sell those programs as they detected a “virus” on the user’s PC and pretend to remove it after the user payed for it. Those are sometimes called “scareware”.</p>

            <h4>Forced Redirecting</h4>

            <p>This works very familiarly as pop-ups. The user is redirected to some external sites that are inappropriate or dangerous.  </p>

            <h3> Prevention </h3>


            <h4>Human error and not paying attention
            </h4>

            <p>Pay attention. Be careful with what you post and what you open. If you do open a link by accident and something unexpected started happening, run your anti-virus to check if a virus wasn’t downloaded onto your device. Tumblr also offers a set of settings that can help stay secure or block certain types of posts.

            </p>

            <p> Do not download any content from those websites.

            </p>

            <h4>Phishing scams
            </h4>

            <p>Do not open messages from users that you do not know and do not open any links that they send you.
            </p>

            <p>Do not share your information with any one the internet unless you are sure that the source is secure.
            </p>

            <p>Do not open any links on Tumblr which you are unsure about and if you do don’t share any personal information on those websites.
            </p>

            <p>Do not trust a source on the basis that there are likes and comments on the post, those can be fake comments and likes as done in 2012.
            </p>

            <p>Tumblr allows users to report any issues that “could jeopardize users’ blogs, expose their personal information, or allow any other nefarious activity to occur.”
